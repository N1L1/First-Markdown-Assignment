\textbf{Data analysis} is \emph{an important process to make the right
decisions.} When one began to gather and analyze data, one will likely
find it easier to reach a particular decision to make (Business
Insights, 2019). With the use of data analysis, a complex and abstract
problem is being simplified into series of small problems that can now
be solved with the help of available data. The options are now being
weighed based on different criteria that one has set to satisfy his own
wants and needs. Because data is available everywhere and we acquire it
every day, we started to look for patterns to make sense of the
scattered data available.

Data science is \emph{being used as a tool to communicate with a certain
group of people}, thus, it \emph{helps in improving people's lives.}
This should be the main goal of a certain organization in obtaining and
collecting data to design different tools that will help in improving
people's lives. Also, the use of data science allows organizations and
individuals to more effectively determine the cause of the problem. With
the help of data analysis, one will be able to visualize and determine
striking relationships between circumstances that they encountered. When
the problems have been pointed out, they will be able to strategize
approaches in solving a particular problem that will increase their
efficiency. Data analysis helps an individual and an organization to
determine which should take priority over the others (The Council on
Quality and Leadership, n.d.).

Data interpretation and analysis is a significant aspect when we work
with data sets in any field we are in. As we analyze data, it becomes
helpful for us to acquire useful and relevant information from a lot of
unorganized data that will enable us to arrive at a solid decision that
is not only useful for businesses and researchers, but also for
individuals.

The pandemic has brought us lots of challenges that made us look for
ways on how to survive the economic regression. A lot of Filipinos have
started their own small businesses such as online thrift shops, foods,
and many more. Because of this, I became interested in the growth of
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the Philippines. Big
businesses are the ones who may control the stock market, but it is the
small businesses and start ups that keep the economy moving. Small
businesses are commonly found in the local barangays and places, thus,
generating more jobs and opportunities for local individuals. Small
businesses also have great potential because it is more often started by
individuals who have great ideas and aims to bring innovation and
something new in the industry.

This topic is timely and relevant to what the country is experiencing
and it becomes more interesting on how people are dealing with the lack
of jobs and worsening economy by establishing their own small
businesses. We can gather data from the website of the Department of
Trade and Industry for the number of small businesses established for
2018-2019, the United Nations Philippines official website, and other
studies about the growth of MSMEs in the Philippines more especially in
the time of the pandemic.

The statistical methods that we will be using for this study would be
numerical analysis of pre-existing data from reliable sources, data
management, and making generalizations and conclusions based on the data
that we have gathered. The main group of people who will benefit from
this study is those who have plans in starting their own businesses in
the middle of the pandemic and existing MSME owners so they can devise
their own plans for the betterment of their business.
